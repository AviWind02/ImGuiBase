# ImGuiBase

ImGuiBase is a C++ application template that provides a foundation for developing applications with an ImGui-based user interface and DirectX 11 rendering capabilities. It integrates Dear ImGui and a library called Notify, which allows you to display toast notifications within the ImGui window.

## Prerequisites

Before using this application template, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Visual Studio (or another C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher)
- DirectX 11 SDK

## Getting Started

To get started with ImGuiBase, follow these steps:

1. Open the solution file (`ImGuiBase.sln`) in Visual Studio.

2. Build the solution to compile the application.

3. Run the compiled executable to launch the application.

## Usage

ImGuiBase provides a basic structure for your C++ application. The ImGui UI framework is integrated, allowing you to easily create user interfaces for your application.

To customize the application, you can modify the existing code or add new functionality as needed. The ImGui library offers a wide range of widgets and utilities that can be used to create interactive and responsive interfaces.

The Notify library allows you to display toast notifications within the ImGui window. Refer to the Notify documentation for more information on how to use it.
